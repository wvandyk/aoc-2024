# Advent of Code 2024

## Requirements:

VS2022 community edition.

## Building:

Open the Visual Studio developer console and run `build.bat` in the root of the project.
The `build.bat` file is simple and braindead on purpose so if your visual studio is not
installed in the same place as mine, you will need to modify it to suit your needs.

I have supplied my input in the `assets` folder.

Run the compiled executable by typing `build\aoc2024.exe` in the root of the project so that
the executable can find the `assets` folder.
